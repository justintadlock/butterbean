# ButterBean

ButterBean is a framework for creating cool post meta boxes.

**Development environments only:** Please note that this is a development version of the code.  Don't use on a live site yet.

## Usage

This is a quick guide.  If you're familiar with the WordPress Customization API, you should probably pick this up fairly quickly.  A lot of the same concepts are used here.

### Installation

Drop the `butterbean` folder into your plugin. That's the simple part.

You're only going to want to load this on the edit post screen for whatever post type you're using it on.

```php
add_action( 'load-post.php'     'th_load' );
add_action( 'load-post-new.php' 'th_load' );

function th_load() {

	// Bail if not our post type.
	if ( 'your_post_type' !== get_current_screen()->post_type )
		return;

	require_once( 'path/to/butterbean/butterbean.php' );
}
```

### Registration

There's a built-in action hook called `butterbean_register`.  You're going to use that to register everything.  So, you need to set up a callback function for that.

```php
add_action( 'butterbean_register', 'th_register', 10, 2 );

function th_register( $butterbean, $post_type ) {

	// Register managers, sections, controls, and settings here.
}
```

#### Registering a manager

A **manager** is a group of sections, controls, and settings.  It's displayed as a single meta box.  There can be multiple managers per screen (don't try multiples yet).

```php
$butterbean->register_manager(
	'example',
	array(
		'label'     => esc_html__( 'Example', 'your-textdomain' ),
		'post_type' => 'your_post_type',
		'context'   => 'normal',
		'priority'  => 'high'
	)
);

$manager = $butterbean->get_manager( 'example' );
```

#### Registering a sections

A **section** is a group of controls within a manager.  They are presented as "tabbed" sections in the UI.

```php
$manager->register_section(
	'section_1',
	array(
		'label' => esc_html__( 'Section 1', 'your-textdomain' ),
		'icon'  => 'dashicons-admin-generic'
	)
);
```

#### Registering a control

A **control** is essentially a form field. It's the field(s) that a user enters data into.  Each control belongs to a section.  Each control should also be tied to a setting (below).

```php
$manager->register_control(
	'abc_xyz', // Same as setting name.
	array(
		'type'    => 'text',
		'section' => 'section_1',
		'label'   => esc_html__( 'Control ABC', 'your-textdomain' ),
		'attr'    => array( 'class' => 'widefat' )
	)
);
```

#### Registering a setting

A **setting** is nothing more than some post metadata and how it gets stored.  A setting belongs to a specific control.

```php
$manager->register_setting(
	'abc_xyz', // Same as control name.
	array(
		'sanitize_callback' => 'wp_filter_nohtml_kses'
	)
);
```
